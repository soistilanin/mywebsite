    <h2>Rejection</h2>
    <h3>Nina Litsios, February 12th, 2026</h3>
    <p>Welcome to my personal website (mostly blog). While it does exist it does so in a process of becoming. To some extent this is because I am not totally sure what I am. I am human enough that I am lost; there’s no doubt about that. I am confused, I think. That’s also something that is not completely clear to me yet. Still, I hold on to the idea that I will figure it out at some point. This is a site of experimentation, don't forget! Potting soil in which the seeds that I plant can grow because they are nourished by the sunlight and the water and the nutrients found in the depths of the internet.</p>

    <p>Like my own mind this page is a work in progress. Soon it will be fuller and more complex and potentially set in stone, but right now that isn't the case. What will spill on it? Perhaps my thoughts; maybe pieces of pasts that linger into the now. I wonder! Probably I will add projects that reflect positively on me. I might also share some unfinished work, or some notes. This is all very exciting.  </p>
